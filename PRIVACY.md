# Privacy Policy

This document describes our privacy policy regarding processing and storing data on Firebase.\
If you do not feel safe using our existing storage, feel free to set up your own (it's really easy) and use that in combination
with a [local setup](./MANUAL.md#local) instead.

## tl;dr

We process and store only what we need to provide functionality and keep your data safe - nothing more and nothing less. We treat your data conscientiously.

## Long version

__We store and/or process only the data we need to ensure convenient and secure access to your personal application data.__\
That includes the following:

* your email address (more on that later)
* a secure hash of your password
* secure hashes of the workspace names you are using
* current in-game day and reminders per workspace

__Stored data is encrypted, but not end-to-end encrypted. That means that only you and the administrator are able to see your data.__\
We decided that end-to-end encryption would hinder convenience more than it would provide security, considering that we basically
only store numbers and context-free information about your role-playing games. For that reason, the administrator _would_ be able to look at your
data, but they won't.

__The administrator will never look at your data without your consent.__\
It has been said, but we think this is an important point.

__We will never share any of your data with third parties.__\
That concerns especially the email address you use to sign up and sign in.

__We will never send you any emails that do not concern authentication or re-authentication.__\
As per the time of this writing, we don't even send emails concerning authentication, so feel free to use a fake email address. That means you won't be able
to change your password or email address though (once we've implemented those features).

__We do not track, analyze or process any personal data or data that can be traced back to your person.__\
In this context, our definition of "personal data" is that of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). That means we do not track, analyze or process your
IP and that we do not use tracking or identifying cookies or similar information.

__We support the right to be forgotten.__\
If you want your data removed, simply send an email request from the email you used to sign up. Your data will then be removed completely.
